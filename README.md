## Preview

There are a lot more icons that changed that are not in this preview, I don't wanna screenshot every single one of them, but feel free to do so if you wanna contribute. 
<br/>
**NOTE:** This preview is taken with [Dracula theme](https://github.com/x6r/dracula/) and [Context icons](https://github.com/CreArts-Community/Context-Icons). Remember, this GoogleMaterialIcons theme changes how icons look, not add more icons.

### Description
All of the icons are taken from https://fonts.google.com/icons?selected=Material+Icons
    
If you have any suggestions/ideas, feel free to create an issue, or ping/dm me in Discord (DavidNyan10#8581). Pull requests are very much appreciated. 

Also, some icons are a bit ugly and don't look too good. Feel free to make suggestions and PRs. And not all of the icons are complete, there are some icons that I didn't see/didn't know existed, and some which I don't know what Google Material Icon to replace with. If you see them, feel free to fix them.
